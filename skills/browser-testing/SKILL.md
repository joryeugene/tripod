# Browser Testing

Two tools for browser automation and inspection. Pick based on the project.

## Which tool?

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| E2E test automation, form filling | Playwright MCP | Native tool calls, structured output |
| Network inspection, console monitoring | Chrome DevTools MCP | Real-time Chrome inspection |
| Rapid iteration, many sequential checks | browse CLI | Persistent daemon, 100ms per call |
| Accessibility tree snapshots, element refs | browse CLI | `@e1` refs with fast-fail on stale DOM |
| Cookie import from real browser session | browse CLI | Pulls from Chrome/Arc/Brave/Edge via macOS Keychain |
| Quick one-off screenshot or navigation | Either | Both work, MCP is zero-setup |

## Authenticated Sessions

Chrome DevTools MCP launches its own Chromium by default with no cookies or logins. To control your real Chrome instead:

1. In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` and enable it
2. Set the `--autoConnect` flag in `.mcp.json`:

```json
"chrome-devtools": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest", "--autoConnect"]
}
```

3. Restart the Claude Code session

All Chrome DevTools MCP tools now operate on your real browser with existing sessions intact. The `--autoConnect` flag is included in all tripod MCP presets by default. When `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` is not enabled, the MCP falls back to launching its own Chromium.

## Setup

**MCP tools** (zero build step):
```bash
mcp-use browser    # playwright + chrome-devtools -> .mcp.json
mcp-use playwright # playwright only
mcp-use chrome     # chrome-devtools only
```

Restart Claude Code after running to pick up the new `.mcp.json`.

**browse CLI** (persistent daemon, requires bun):
```bash
cd ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/browse && ./setup
```

The binary lands at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/browse/dist/browse`. First call ~3s to launch Chromium; subsequent calls 100-200ms. Auto-shuts down after 30 minutes of inactivity.

## MCP tools: Playwright

When `mcp-use playwright` or `mcp-use browser` is active, the Playwright MCP server provides these tools:

**Navigation**
- `browser_navigate` - go to a URL
- `browser_go_back` / `browser_go_forward` - history navigation
- `browser_wait` - wait for page to settle

**Content reading**
- `browser_snapshot` - accessibility tree with element refs
- `browser_take_screenshot` - viewport or element screenshot
- `browser_get_text` - extract visible text

**Interaction**
- `browser_click` - click an element (by ref from snapshot)
- `browser_type` - type text into a field
- `browser_select_option` - select from dropdown
- `browser_hover` - hover over element
- `browser_press_key` - keyboard input (Enter, Tab, Escape, etc.)
- `browser_drag` - drag and drop

**Tabs**
- `browser_tab_list` - list open tabs
- `browser_tab_new` - open new tab
- `browser_tab_select` - switch tab
- `browser_tab_close` - close tab

### Standard test loop (Playwright MCP)

```
1. browser_navigate to the target URL
2. browser_snapshot to see initial state and get element refs
3. browser_click / browser_type to interact
4. browser_snapshot again to verify the DOM changed
5. browser_take_screenshot for visual proof
```

After page mutations, always re-snapshot before using element refs. Stale refs from a previous snapshot will target the wrong element.

## MCP tools: Chrome DevTools

When `mcp-use chrome` or `mcp-use browser` is active, the Chrome DevTools MCP server provides inspection tools for a running Chrome instance.

**Network**
- Capture and inspect network requests/responses
- View headers, status codes, timing, payload sizes

**Console**
- Read console messages (errors, warnings, logs)
- Evaluate JavaScript expressions in page context

**DOM**
- Inspect and query DOM nodes
- Get computed styles, element attributes

### When to use DevTools vs Playwright

Playwright drives a headless browser from scratch. Chrome DevTools attaches to an existing Chrome session. Use DevTools when you need to inspect a page that requires a real logged-in browser session, or when you need network-level detail that Playwright does not expose.

## browse CLI

The `browse` binary is a persistent Chromium daemon built on Playwright and Bun. Based on [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) by Garry Tan (MIT).

**Navigation**
- `browse goto <url>` - navigate to URL
- `browse back` / `browse forward` - history
- `browse reload` - reload page
- `browse url` - print current URL

**Content reading**
- `browse text` - visible text content
- `browse html` - page HTML
- `browse links` - all links on page
- `browse forms` - all forms and their fields
- `browse accessibility` - accessibility tree

**Snapshots (element refs)**
- `browse snapshot` - accessibility tree with `@e1`, `@e2` element refs
- `browse snapshot -D` - diff mode (show what changed since last snapshot)
- `browse snapshot -i` - inline mode (compact output)
- `browse snapshot -c` - compact mode
- `browse snapshot -d N` - limit depth to N levels
- `browse snapshot -s <selector>` - scope to CSS selector

Element refs (`@e1`, `@e2`) are based on the accessibility tree, not DOM injection. They fail fast (~5ms) when the DOM has changed, instead of hanging for 30 seconds on a stale selector.

**Interaction**
- `browse click [selector|@ref]` - click an element
- `browse fill <selector|@ref> <text>` - fill a text input
- `browse select <selector|@ref> <value>` - select dropdown option
- `browse hover <selector|@ref>` - hover over element
- `browse type <text>` - type text into focused element
- `browse press <key>` - press a keyboard key (Enter, Tab, Escape, Shift+L, etc.)
- `browse scroll [direction] [amount]` - scroll the page
- `browse wait [selector|timeout]` - wait for element or duration
- `browse viewport <width> <height>` - resize viewport

**Debugging**
- `browse js <expression>` - execute JavaScript, returns value
- `browse console` - get console messages (errors, warnings, logs)
- `browse network` - list captured network requests
- `browse dialog` - check for and handle alert/confirm/prompt dialogs
- `browse cookies` - list cookies
- `browse storage` - inspect localStorage/sessionStorage
- `browse css <selector>` - computed styles for element
- `browse attrs <selector>` - element attributes

**Visual capture**
- `browse screenshot` - viewport screenshot
- `browse screenshot --clip <selector>` - cropped to element
- `browse responsive` - screenshots at multiple breakpoints

**Cookie/Auth import**
- `browse cookie-import <filepath>` - import cookies from JSON file
- `browse cookie-import-browser` - auto-import sessions from Chrome/Arc/Brave/Edge via macOS Keychain

**Tab management**
- `browse tabs` - list open tabs
- `browse tab <index>` - switch to tab
- `browse newtab [url]` - open new tab
- `browse closetab` - close current tab

### Standard test loop (browse CLI)

```
1. browse goto <url>
2. browse snapshot                # see initial state + get element refs
3. browse console                 # check for JS errors on load
4. browse js "DOM assertion"      # verify state before interacting
5. browse click @e3               # perform action
6. browse snapshot -D             # diff to see what changed
7. browse network                 # verify API calls fired
```

After page mutations, always re-snapshot before using element refs.

## Keyboard Testing

Keyboard handlers require real key simulation, not text injection.

### `press_key` vs `type_text`

| Tool | Behavior | Use when |
|------|----------|----------|
| `press_key` | Fires `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup` events through DOM event flow | Testing keyboard shortcuts, overlay handlers, modal key dispatch |
| `type_text` | Injects text directly into focused element, bypassing DOM events | Filling form fields where you need the final value, not the event |

`type_text` bypasses the event listener chain entirely. A keyboard handler bug (undefined function, wrong dispatch, capture-phase conflict) will not surface with `type_text`. The handler never fires.

When testing keyboard shortcuts: always `press_key`. When filling an input field value: `type_text` is acceptable but `press_key` per character is more realistic.

### Keyboard test loop

```
1. Navigate to the page
2. Check console for JS errors (clean baseline)
3. press_key the shortcut
4. Check console again (catch ReferenceError, TypeError from handler)
5. Verify DOM changed (snapshot diff, js assertion, or element screenshot)
6. Test each sub-command within the overlay
7. press_key Escape to close
8. Verify overlay closed and page focus restored
```

### Common keyboard testing failures

| Failure | Symptom | Root cause |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Key does nothing | No console error, no DOM change | Key missing from dispatch logic |
| ReferenceError on keypress | Console shows undefined variable | JS references non-existent identifier |
| Overlay input broken | Cannot type in text fields | Capture-phase handler intercepts all keys without input element guard |

## Chrome DevTools MCP: Modifier Keys

Chrome DevTools `press_key` does NOT synthesize shift modifiers when sending uppercase letters.

```javascript
// press_key("L") generates: {key: "L", shiftKey: false, code: "KeyL"}
// This breaks handlers that check e.shiftKey to distinguish Shift+L from column navigation
```

**Workaround:** Use `evaluate_script` to dispatch a synthetic event with the correct modifiers:

```javascript
document.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {
  key: 'L', code: 'KeyL', shiftKey: true, bubbles: true, cancelable: true
}));
```

**Pitfall with `Shift+l` syntax:** `press_key("Shift+l")` fires two separate events: first `ShiftLeft` (captured by listeners checking `e.key==='Shift'`), then `l` with `shiftKey:true`. If your listener removes itself after the first event (the Shift keydown), it won't see the second. Listen for the actual character key, not the modifier.

## Binary/Bundle Staleness

When an app bundles its frontend (Python serving inline JS, Electron, packaged CLI), the running binary may NOT match the source. Bugs visible in the browser may already be fixed in source -- the binary just hasn't been rebuilt.

Before concluding a bug is unfixed: rebuild the binary and test again.

```bash
# Python CLI example
uv tool install --force --reinstall .
# Then restart the server and retest
```

If tests pass after rebuild without any source changes, the bug was in the stale binary, not the source. The fix was the rebuild.

## Verifying State After Async Operations

After browser interactions that trigger API calls (mutations), the DOM may not update synchronously. Use `evaluate_script` with a small delay to verify final state:

```javascript
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => {
  const item = appState?.items?.find(item => item.id === targetId);
  resolve(item?.status);
}, 500))
```

Or check the DOM class directly rather than the JS state variable:

```javascript
() => document.querySelector('.card.nav-selected')?.className
// More reliable than reading JS variables which may not reflect DOM truth
```

## JS State Variables vs DOM Truth

App state variables (`selectedCol`, `selectedCard`) can be set directly from `evaluate_script`, but this does NOT update the DOM (no `nav-selected` class moves, no visual feedback). Functions that read the DOM (like `_getSelectedId()` using `querySelector('.card.nav-selected')`) will ignore the programmatically set variable.

Always verify which state a tested function reads -- JS variable or DOM class -- before reasoning about expected behavior.

## Bugs That Only Surface Through Real Interaction

These bug patterns are invisible to unit tests and only appear via browser testing:

1. **Broken promise chains:** `fetchData()` called without `return` in a `.then()` chain means the next `.then()` fires before the fetch resolves. The UI appears to work (no error) but shows stale data. Fix: always `return fetchData()`.

2. **Off-by-default index:** An operation always targets index 0 instead of the item the user navigated to. Passes in demos where index 0 is always selected, fails in real use when any other item is focused.

3. **Double-remove on detached DOM nodes:** When two code paths can remove the same element (e.g., `hideOverlay()` clears innerHTML AND an Escape handler calls `inp.remove()`), the second call throws `NotFoundError`. Fix: guard with `if(inp.parentNode) inp.remove()`. This is idempotent -- attached node removes, detached node does nothing.

## What NOT to do

- Do not trust a single screenshot as proof. Verify with `js` or `snapshot` to confirm DOM state matches visual appearance.
- Do not use stale element refs after page mutations. Always re-snapshot to get fresh refs.
- Do not skip console checks after navigation. JS errors that break functionality are silent without checking.
- Do not use snapshot as the only verification. Combine with `js` for precise DOM assertions (class presence, attribute values, computed styles).
- Do not use `type_text` to test keyboard shortcuts. It bypasses event listeners entirely and hides real bugs. Use `press_key`.
- Do not set JS state variables via `evaluate_script` and assume DOM-reading functions will see the change. Confirm the DOM class is also updated.
