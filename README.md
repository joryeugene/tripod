Skills alone make Claude better at tasks. This makes Claude better at engineering.

## Three layers

```
                    claude-stack
                          |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
        |                 |                 |
   CLAUDE.md           hooks/            skills/
  (philosophy)       (enforcement)      (workflow)
  always loaded      always fires       on demand
        |                 |                 |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
                          |
             ./setup installs all three
```

**Philosophy** (`CLAUDE.md`) defines how Claude reasons: the Tripod (antifragile, simple, research-first), the Contract (total saturation, no shortcuts), and the Error Recovery Protocol.

**Enforcement** (`hooks/`) makes rules structural. A rule in CLAUDE.md is a suggestion. A hook is a hard constraint. The wrong pattern becomes structurally impossible, not just discouraged.

**Skills** (`skills/`) give Claude the right cognitive mode for each moment in the workflow.

---

## Why three layers

Most Claude Code setups are skills-only. Skills are cognitive suggestions. Claude receives them as context, weighs them probabilistically, and may or may not follow them. A skill that says "don't use em-dashes" works until it doesn't.

A hook that blocks em-dashes at the file write level is a different category of thing. It cannot be forgotten. It cannot be deprioritized mid-session. It fires before the tool call completes.

CLAUDE.md works at a third level: it changes how Claude frames problems before any decision is made. The Tripod (antifragile, simple, research-first) runs before architecture, before implementation, before choosing what to build. Skills change what Claude does. CLAUDE.md changes how Claude thinks.

The three layers are not additive. They are multiplicative. Each one makes the other two more effective.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joryeugene/claude-stack.git ~/.claude/skills/claude-stack
cd ~/.claude/skills/claude-stack
./setup
```

Then register the hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. See `settings.json.example`.

Set the environment variables (recommended): see `env.sh.example`.

## The workflow

```
  project starts
       |
       v
   /plan-mode  ------- CEO: is this the right problem?
       |                Eng: can we build it safely?
       |
   coding begins
       |
       +--- /debugging-protocol ----- something broken?
       |                              schema first, trace back
       |
       +--- /verification-workflow -- after every change:
       |                              prove it works, show evidence
       |
       +--- /testing-strategy ------- writing tests?
       |                              make them catch real bugs
       |
       +--- /code-hygiene ----------- AI sessions are stateless.
       |                              keep the codebase clean.
       |
       |   (building UI?)
       +--- /impeccable-design ------ visual identity before a line of code
       +--- /visual-verify ---------- element-level proof after UI changes
       |
   ready to ship
       |
       v
   /pre-ship ---------- paranoid check: what does CI miss?
       |
       v
   /ship-pipeline ----- merge, test, review, commit, push, PR


  always active (no invocation needed)

   /agent-principles      the quality contract: evidence, schema-first, no hedging
   /hooks-guide           teaches you to build your own enforcement layer
   /agent-orchestration   parallel agents for independent work streams
```

---

## The hooks

Two hooks ship with claude-stack. Both run on `PreToolUse`.

| Hook | Blocks | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `block-unicode-dashes.py` | Em-dashes, en-dashes, double-hyphen substitutes in written files | Prose quality rule made structurally impossible |
| `block-co-authored-by.py` | Claude attribution lines in git commits | Claude Code hardcodes this into every commit message. This hook removes it. |
| `block-git-stash.py` | `git stash` in any form | Destroys other agents' working state. Structurally absent, not just discouraged. |
| `block-no-verify.py` | `--no-verify` in git commands | Bypassing hooks defeats the enforcement layer. Fix the root cause instead. |
| `block-tmp-files.py` | Writes to `/tmp/` and `mktemp` | Files in /tmp are silently lost on cleanup. Write to the project directory. |

Register both in `~/.claude/settings.json`. See `settings.json.example`.

---

## The skills

Each skill owns one moment in the workflow. Invoke with `/skill-name` in Claude Code.

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/agent-principles` | Always active reference. The quality contract. |
| `/hooks-guide` | Learning to write your own enforcement hooks. |
| `/agent-orchestration` | Parallel agents for independent work streams. Task tool and agent teams. |
| `/plan-mode` | Before any significant work. CEO mode or Eng mode. |
| `/debugging-protocol` | Something isn't working. Schema first, trace back. |
| `/verification-workflow` | After a code change. Prove it works before moving on. |
| `/testing-strategy` | Writing tests. Make them fail when code breaks. |
| `/code-hygiene` | Reviewing AI-session debt: dead exports, duplicate logic, orphaned types. |
| `/impeccable-design` | Starting UI work. Visual identity before writing code. |
| `/visual-verify` | After UI changes. Element-level proof, not full-page screenshots. |
| `/pre-ship` | Before shipping. Paranoid check for the bugs CI misses. |
| `/ship-pipeline` | Shipping. Merge, test, review, commit, push, PR. |

## CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` is the operating spec. It defines three things:

1. **The Tripod** - root philosophy that governs every design decision
2. **The Contract** - rigor standards (total saturation, no shortcuts, adversarial thinking)
3. **Forbidden Patterns** - antifragile list of banned behaviors; grows with every failure

Adapt it for your stack:

**Keep as-is:** The Tripod, the Contract, Error Recovery Protocol, the absolute BANNED tier.

**Customize:** The Quick Reference trigger table (add your tools and workflows). The Forbidden Patterns anti-patterns tier (add failure patterns you encounter). The Prose Quality Standards are optional if you don't write prose with Claude.

Place the file at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for global effect, or at the project root for project-specific behavior.

---

## Environment

Claude Code exposes environment variables that significantly change its behavior. These are set before a session starts. See `env.sh.example` for the full list with explanations.

Key variables:

| Variable | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `65536` | Prevents response truncation on long outputs |
| `BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | 5-minute default; prevents premature kills |
| `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` | `100000` | Captures full output from verbose commands |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | `1` | Enables parallel agent spawning |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | `80` | Compacts at 80% context, not 95% |
| `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR` | `1` | Shell cwd persists across tool calls |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` | `1` | No telemetry pings during sessions |

Two ways to apply: source `env.sh.example` from your shell profile, or copy the variables into `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` key (recommended: settings.json approach applies at session start without shell config changes).

### Statusline

`statusline.sh` provides a compact Claude Code status display: current directory, git branch, context usage percentage, active plan, model, and subscription tier. Wire it into `settings.json`:

```json
"statusCommand": "~/.claude/skills/claude-stack/statusline.sh"
```

---

## Adding your own hooks

The `/hooks-guide` skill covers this in full. The short version:

1. Write a Python script that reads tool input from stdin (JSON)
2. Print a block decision to stderr and exit 2 to block the tool call
3. Exit 0 to allow it
4. Register in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks > PreToolUse`

The `block-unicode-dashes.py` hook is a readable reference for the pattern.

---

## Extending with more skills

Drop any directory with a `SKILL.md` into `skills/`. Re-run `./setup` to symlink it.

Skill files are markdown with a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: One sentence. Claude uses this to decide when to load the skill.
---

# Skill content here
```
